In this project I used photos that were taken with my camera. These photos are organized into categories and folders so that the user can conveniently find exactly what he wants. And he can do it by search bar. The site has also implemented a pagination system, so that all the folders are not in one place and do not look like an untidy closet.

When the page refreshes, we see a loading animation in place of the photos

Here is an example of different categories

And this is an example of pagination

Here is also an example of a folder search

This is a prototype project at the moment. But it has its potential, because adding new photos is easy via firebase, and then you can add backend via mockAPI. This is a great example of a website for a travelling photographer who wants to add to his photo collection and share it on his own website.
